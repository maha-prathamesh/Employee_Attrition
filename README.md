# Introduction and Overview

<B>What Is Employee Attrition Rate?</B><BR>
Attrition measures how many people left a company/office/department compared to the average number of people employed in that year. This takes into account fresh hires as well. 

Here’s a simple formula to help you calculate attrition:
Conduct a headcount to know how many employees you started with at the beginning of the year. Let’s say this number is 1,000.
Keep track of how many people leave throughout the year. Let’s say 200 employees left the company due to voluntary and involuntary reasons.
Keep track of the employees you hire across the year, and conduct a final headcount at year-end. Let’s say that you hired 400 people that year – this means your final headcount is 1,400.
Now, calculate the average number of employees for that year. In our example, this will be (1000+1400)/2 = 1,200.
Finally, calculate the number of employees who left as a percentage of the average number of employees. This will give you the attrition rate: (200/1200) x 100 = 16.66%.
Simply put,

<B>Attrition Rate = <font color="red">Number of Attritions/Average Number of Employees x 100</font></B>


## Types of Attrition
1. <b>Retirement</b> - <font color="green">Positive</font><br>

2. <b>Voluntary attrition</b> - <font color="red">Negative</font><br>
    Where employees decide to simply quit their jobs.

3. <b>Involuntary attrition</b> - <font color="green">Positive</font><br>
    It is the company and not the employee that initiates the exit.

4. <b>Internal attrition</b> - <font color="green">Positive</font>/<font color="red">Negative</font><br>
    Employees are quitting their jobs in one department to join another department.

5. <b>Demographic-specific attrition</b> - <font color="red">Negative</font><br>
    This is a significant concern for progressive companies trying to build an equal-opportunities workplace.      Demographic-specific attrition means that employees from a single group – women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, veterans, or older professionals – are leaving the company in droves.<br>
